# Project runtime contract evidence

## Status

- Change: `establish-project-runtime-contract`
- Worker: `codex-worker-01`
- Started: 2026-07-24
- Atenea production routing: unchanged
- Real projects schedulable through Atenea: none

## Administrative Codex bridge

The bridge is intentionally separate from the future managed AgentRun executor.
It runs as the named administrator inside a private SSH/tmux session and is
restricted by Codex's `workspace-write` sandbox. It is suitable for beginning
manual work while the session runtime manager is developed; it is not isolation
evidence for Atenea dispatch.

Verified state:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Official standalone Codex release | `0.145.0` |
| Authentication | ChatGPT device authorization; sanitized status passed |
| Model/config | `gpt-5.6-sol`, medium reasoning, workspace-write, network enabled |
| Doctor | 17 ok, 0 warnings, 0 failures; WebSocket HTTP 101 |
| Linux sandbox prerequisite | Ubuntu `bubblewrap 0.9.0`; specific AppArmor profile enforced |
| Real inference | Returned exactly `AX42_CODEX_OK` from the worker |
| Disconnect continuity | `codex-main` retained the same tmux pane PID across independent SSH connections |
| Operator helper | `codex-work`; laptop shortcut `axcodex` |

No laptop `auth.json`, histories, sessions, logs, caches, SSH keys, complete
Codex home or embedded project credentials were copied. The worker performed
its own device authorization. Only a minimal versioned configuration and worker
instruction file were promoted.

## Beautips administrative source

GitHub and the clean laptop checkout both resolved `main` to
`a6d2f2815153bf54a977f54bb69be3931075e175`. The Atenea checkout resolved to a
different local commit and was not used as the source.

Because the private GitHub remote is not yet authenticated on the worker, a Git
bundle containing committed refs only was verified and used to create:

`/srv/atenea/workspaces/manual/beautips`

The checkout is clean, its `origin` remains
`https://github.com/jlnieto/beautips.git`, and the `codex-beautips` tmux session
is ready. Fetch/push remains an explicit blocked capability until independent
GitHub authorization is configured.

No Compose runtime, application secret, preview or Atenea routing has been
enabled for Beautips. It remains an administrative source workspace rather than
an onboarded/schedulable project.

## Immediate usage

From the configured laptop:

```bash
axcodex beautips
```

Detach without terminating Codex with `Ctrl-b`, then `d`. The same command
reattaches to the existing conversation.

From another authorized Tailscale device with an SSH client:

```bash
ssh -t jose@codex-worker-01 \
  /home/jose/.local/bin/codex-work beautips \
  /srv/atenea/workspaces/manual/beautips
```

The mobile/Atenea conversational interface remains part of the managed remote
routing phase; SSH is the initial continuity bridge.
